An effective way is to use an coding that is specific and personal.

For example, you tell the human readers that they need to delete all $ in the email address to get the real one.
In this case, your true email is 1233@example.com
By encoding with $, you provide your email as 123$3@ex$ample.com

By doing this, the human readers will get your true email by just deleting all the two $.
However, the machine won't know because it doesn't look for other information besides the pattern assigned to it.
